(1) Explain data science in your own words. Imagine that your audience are your family members, friends, or anyone without any knowledge in related fields. References that might help craft an answer. More could be found by simply searching for "data science" on the Internet. 
    - [ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science](https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/)
    - [Mission of Department of Statistics, UC Davis. ](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/mission)
    - [Statement by the UCD DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/about/)
    - [Data science on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) 

Data science is essentially taking information (or data), and deriving meaning from it. The study uses critical thinking and analaysis, intersected with statistics/programming, and a domain/field of study (politics, business, technology, etc.).

(2)  Please review the common tasks of data science in Chapter 1 of the course notes and identify your strengths in data science. 

In particular,
  (i) describe the top two strengths (skills/characteristics/knowledge/...) of yours that apply to data science;
  I am skilled in ggplot() and data visualization tools to illustrate datasets.In domain knowledge, I am skilled in policy analysis, computer science (programming), retail and operations. 
  
  (ii) briefly review how you developed these strengths;  
  I was able to acquire data visualization skills through POL 51, and my Google Data Analytics Certificate Program. In my domain knowledge, I acquired my skills through work and school leadership experience. 
  
  (iii) explain how you plan to contribute to the final project with these strengths. 
  Applying my skills to the final project, I would feel confident visualizing the data through graphs, and creating analyses based off of the illustrations. 

***

(3) Please review the common tasks of data science in Chapter 1 of the course notes and identify the task that you are least confident about. 

In particular, please explain 
  (i) what this task means with an example; 
  The analysis task of a data scientist through statistical models, statistical theory, optimization, etc., is what I feel least confident about. Examples of this would be building statistical models to predict or analyze data. 
  
  (ii) why you feel least confident about this task; 
  I feel least confident with theoretical and foundational statistics because this is my first few statistics classes I have taken in my education career, which is definitely an adjustment. In addition, I am only grasping the tip of the iceberg, and I have so much more to learn. 
  
  (iii) how you plan to improve your confidence. 
  I would plan on utilizing office hours and TA hours to ask questions and clarify statistical concepts. I also plan on interacting and collaborating with my peers and network with them so I don't feel left out. 

(4) Consider  `81`,`170`,`1923`,`3825`.
```{r}
values <- c(81, 170, 1923, 3825) #creating vector
```

(i) Check if they are divisible by `3` and `9`. 
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
divisible_by_3 <- values %% 3 == 0 #checking if div by 3
divisible_by_9 <- values %% 9 == 0 #checking if div by 9

# Printing results
result <- data.frame(Number = values, Divisible_by_3 = divisible_by_3, Divisible_by_9 = divisible_by_9)
print(result)
```

(ii) Use integer division to calculate the sum of the digits of the numbers (e.g, the sum of the digits of `234` is `2+3+4=9`).
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Function to calculate the sum of digits
sum_of_digits <- function(n) {
  sum(n %/% 10^(0:(nchar(n)-1)) %% 10)
}

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number
sum_digits_result <- sapply(values, sum_of_digits)

# Print results
result <- data.frame(Number = values, Sum_of_Digits = sum_digits_result)
print(result)
```

(iii) Check whether these sums are divisible by `3` and `9`. 
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Function to calculate the sum of digits
sum_of_digits <- function(n) {
  sum(n %/% 10^(0:(nchar(n)-1)) %% 10)
}

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number
sum_digits_result <- sapply(values, sum_of_digits)

# Check divisibility by 3 and 9
divisible_by_3 <- sum_digits_result %% 3 == 0
divisible_by_9 <- sum_digits_result %% 9 == 0

# Print results
result <- data.frame(Number = values, Sum_of_Digits = sum_digits_result, Divisible_by_3 = divisible_by_3, Divisible_by_9 = divisible_by_9)
print(result)
```
(iv) State your observations from (i) and (iii) and verify your hypothesis on more numbers, if any. 

*Information obtained from ChatGPT
Two main observations are found, where: 
 1.) If the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. 
 2.) Similarly, if the sumn of digits is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9.

(5) Read the help file for the `prod()` function. 
```{r}
?prod()
```

(i) Define `a <- c(2,4,6)`, `b <- c(1,3,5)`,  `c <- c(3,5,7)`,  use `a`,`b`,`c` and `prod()` to calculate 
$$
2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\right) \left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{6}{5}\cdot \frac{6}{7}\right).
$$
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Generate vectors a, b, and c
a <- c(2, 4, 6)
b <- c(1, 3, 5)
c <- c(3, 5, 7)

result <- 2 * prod(a / b) * prod(a / c)

# Display the result
print(result)
```

(ii) Calculate 
$$
2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\right) \left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)\cdots
\left(\frac{1000}{999}\cdot \frac{1000}{1001}\right)
$$
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Generate vectors a, b, and c
a <- seq(2, 1000, 2)
b <- seq(1, 999, 2)
c <- seq(3, 1001, 2)

# Calculate the result
result <- 2 * prod(a / b) * prod(b / c)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

(6) Write a function to calculate the following quantity for any given input $n$. Report the values (up to 6 [significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) ) for $n=17, 91, 216$. 

$$
2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\right) \left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)\cdots
\left(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\cdot \frac{2n}{2n+1}\right)
$$
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
calculate_quantity <- function(n) {
  result <- 2
  
  for (i in 2:n) {
    result <- result * (2*i / (2*i - 1)) * (2*i / (2*i + 1))
  }
  
  return(result)
}

# Calculate and print the values for n = 17, 91, 216
n_values <- c(17, 91, 216)
results <- sapply(n_values, calculate_quantity)

# Display the results with 6 significant figures
results_rounded <- round(results, 6)
cat("For n =", n_values, ", the calculated values are:", results_rounded, "\n")
```

(7) Apply your function in (6) on $n=5,10, 15, \ldots, 500$. Draw a scatterplot between the outputs of your function versus the values of $n$s. State your findings, if any. 
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Values of n from 5 to 500
new_values <- seq(5, 500, by = 5)

# Calculate the outputs for each value of n
output_values <- sapply(new_values, calculate_quantity)

# Create a scatterplot
plot(new_values, output_values, xlab = "n", ylab = "Output", main = "Scatterplot of Function Outputs")

# Add a trendline
fit <- lm(output_values ~ new_values)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```
 Observations obtained from scatterplot:
 *Information acquired from ChatGPT
 1.) The regression line illustrates a positive relationship between n and output values.
 2.) An outlier at n=0 could deviate significantly from the overall pattern. Further statistical analysis and testing can be conducted to futher assess its significance. 
 3.) The scatterplot of points illustrate a logarithmic pattern.
 
(8) For the rest of the problems, we will examine the `cars` dataset included in `R`. We can load `cars` with `data(cars)` if it is not in the workspace yet. 

Ask `R` to report the first six observations in `cars`, and count how many observations and variables are in the dataset. 
```{r}
data(cars)

# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
# Display the first six observations
first_six_observations <- head(cars)
print("First six observations:")
print(first_six_observations)

# Count the number of observations and variables
num_observations <- nrow(cars)
num_variables <- ncol(cars)
print(paste("Number of observations:", num_observations))
print(paste("Number of variables:", num_variables))
```

(9) What does each column represent, and what is the meaning of their values? 

From ?cars, we obtain the following information:

Column 1 represents the numeric Speed (mph)
Column 2 represents the distance, the numeric Stopping distance (measured in feet)

(10) What does each row represent? 

Each row represents an observation on both variables speed and dist.

(11) Create a scatterplot of  variables in `cars`. Explain your observations on the scatter plot. 
```{r}
# Code chunk obtained from ChatGPT
plot(cars, main = "Scatterplot of Variables in 'cars' Dataset", xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Dist")
```

(4) Consider  `81`,`170`,`1923`,`3825`.
in r, Check if they are divisible by `3` and `9`. 

2 / 2


ChatGPT
Sure, in R, you can use the modulo operator (%%) to check if a number is divisible by another. Here's how you can check if the numbers 81, 170, 1923, and 3825 are divisible by both 3 and 9:

R
Copy code
# Numbers to check
numbers <- c(81, 170, 1923, 3825)

# Check divisibility by 3 and 9
divisible_by_3 <- numbers %% 3 == 0
divisible_by_9 <- numbers %% 9 == 0

# Display results
result <- data.frame(Number = numbers, Divisible_by_3 = divisible_by_3, Divisible_by_9 = divisible_by_9)
print(result)
This code will print a table showing whether each number is divisible by 3 and 9. If the value is TRUE, it means the number is divisible; otherwise, it's FALSE.




User
Use integer division to calculate the sum of the digits of the numbers (e.g, the sum of the digits of `234` is `2+3+4=9`

ChatGPT
Certainly! In R, you can use integer division (%/%) and modulo (%%) to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. Here's how you can do it for the numbers 81, 170, 1923, and 3825:

R
Copy code
# Numbers to calculate the sum of digits
numbers <- c(81, 170, 1923, 3825)

# Function to calculate the sum of digits
sum_of_digits <- function(n) {
  sum(n %/% 10^(0:(nchar(n)-1)) %% 10)
}

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number
sum_digits_result <- sapply(numbers, sum_of_digits)

# Display results
result <- data.frame(Number = numbers, Sum_of_Digits = sum_digits_result)
print(result)
This code defines a function sum_of_digits that calculates the sum of the digits using integer division and modulo. Then, it applies this function to each number in the numbers vector and displays the results in a table.




User
Check whether these sums are divisible by `3` and `9`. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! We can extend the previous R code to check whether the sums of digits for each number are divisible by 3 and 9. Here's the modified code:

R
Copy code
# Numbers to calculate the sum of digits
numbers <- c(81, 170, 1923, 3825)

# Function to calculate the sum of digits
sum_of_digits <- function(n) {
  sum(n %/% 10^(0:(nchar(n)-1)) %% 10)
}

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number
sum_digits_result <- sapply(numbers, sum_of_digits)

# Check divisibility by 3 and 9
divisible_by_3 <- sum_digits_result %% 3 == 0
divisible_by_9 <- sum_digits_result %% 9 == 0

# Display results
result <- data.frame(Number = numbers, Sum_of_Digits = sum_digits_result, Divisible_by_3 = divisible_by_3, Divisible_by_9 = divisible_by_9)
print(result)
This code adds the checks for divisibility by 3 and 9 for the sums of digits and displays the results in a table. If the value is TRUE, it means the sum is divisible; otherwise, it's FALSE.




User
State your observations from (i) and (iii) and verify your hypothesis on more numbers, if any. 

ChatGPT
Let's observe the results for the sums of digits and their divisibility by 3 and 9:

R
Copy code
# Numbers to calculate the sum of digits
numbers <- c(81, 170, 1923, 3825)

# Function to calculate the sum of digits
sum_of_digits <- function(n) {
  sum(n %/% 10^(0:(nchar(n)-1)) %% 10)
}

# Calculate the sum of digits for each number
sum_digits_result <- sapply(numbers, sum_of_digits)

# Check divisibility by 3 and 9
divisible_by_3 <- sum_digits_result %% 3 == 0
divisible_by_9 <- sum_digits_result %% 9 == 0

# Display results
result <- data.frame(Number = numbers, Sum_of_Digits = sum_digits_result, Divisible_by_3 = divisible_by_3, Divisible_by_9 = divisible_by_9)
print(result)
Observations:

(i) If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. This is a known property.

(iii) If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9. This is also a known property.

Verification on more numbers:

You can test this hypothesis on more numbers to further confirm the observations. If you have additional numbers you'd like to check, you can include them in the numbers vector and rerun the code. The results should align with the hypothesis that the divisibility of the sum of digits by 3 and 9 implies divisibility of the original number by 3 and 9, respectively.


Define `a <- c(2,4,6)`, `b <- c(1,3,5)`,  `c <- c(3,5,7)`,  use `a`,`b`,`c` and `prod()` to calculate 2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\right) \left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{6}{5}\cdot \frac{6}{7}\right)

in r, Write a function to calculate the following quantity for any given input $n$. Report the values (up to 6 [significant figures] for $n=17, 91, 216$. 

$$
2\cdot \left(\frac{2}{1}\cdot \frac{2}{3}\right) \left(\frac{4}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{5}\right)\cdots
\left(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\cdot \frac{2n}{2n+1}\right)
$$

ChatGPT
Certainly! You can create a function in R to calculate the given quantity for any given input n. Here's the R code for the function:

R
Copy code
calculate_quantity <- function(n) {
  result <- 2
  
  for (i in 2:n) {
    result <- result * (2*i / (2*i - 1)) * (2*i / (2*i + 1))
  }
  
  return(result)
}

# Calculate and print the values for n = 17, 91, 216
n_values <- c(17, 91, 216)

for (n in n_values) {
  result <- calculate_quantity(n)
  cat(sprintf("For n = %d, result = %.6f\n", n, result))
}
This code defines a function calculate_quantity that takes an input n and calculates the specified quantity using a loop. It then prints the results for the specified values of n (17, 91, 216) with up to 6 significant figures.

Apply your function in (6) on $n=5,10, 15, \ldots, 500$. Draw a scatterplot between the outputs of your function versus the values of $n$s. State your findings, if any. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! You can use the function defined earlier to calculate the values for n ranging from 5 to 500 and then create a scatterplot. Here's the R code to achieve that:

R
Copy code
# Function to calculate the quantity
calculate_quantity <- function(n) {
  result <- 2
  
  for (i in 2:n) {
    result <- result * (2*i / (2*i - 1)) * (2*i / (2*i + 1))
  }
  
  return(result)
}

# Values of n from 5 to 500
n_values <- seq(5, 500, by = 5)

# Calculate the outputs for each value of n
output_values <- sapply(n_values, calculate_quantity)

# Create a scatterplot
plot(n_values, output_values, xlab = "n", ylab = "Output", main = "Scatterplot of Function Outputs")

# Add a trendline
fit <- lm(output_values ~ n_values)
abline(fit, col = "red")

# Show the plot
This code generates a scatterplot between the values of n and the corresponding outputs of the function. It also adds a trendline to visualize any patterns. You can observe the trend in the scatterplot and draw conclusions based on it. If there are any specific findings or observations you'd like me to elaborate on, please let me know!


2 / 2




User
State your findings, if any. 

ChatGPT
Unfortunately, I cannot execute the R code or generate the scatterplot directly. However, you can run the provided R code in your local R environment to observe the scatterplot and trends. Here's a general guide on how to interpret the scatterplot:

Trendline: The red trendline added to the scatterplot using linear regression provides insights into the overall trend of the data points. If the trendline shows a clear pattern (e.g., increasing or decreasing), it suggests a relationship between n and the output values.

Scatterplot Distribution: Examine how the data points are distributed. If there is a systematic pattern or if the points cluster in a particular way, it may indicate a trend or relationship.

Outliers: Identify any outliers in the scatterplot. Outliers could be data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern. Understanding outliers is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.

Overall Observation: Look for any overall patterns, trends, or irregularities in the scatterplot. This can help you draw conclusions about how the output values change with different values of n.

Remember that the findings will depend on the specific characteristics of the scatterplot generated using your data. If you encounter challenges or have specific questions about the scatterplot, feel free to share details, and I can assist further!

scatterplot points are logarithmic

ChatGPT
If the scatterplot points are logarithmic, it means that one or both axes are displayed on a logarithmic scale. In this case, you can use logarithmic transformations for one or both of the axes to better visualize and interpret the data. Here's how you can modify the R code to create a scatterplot with logarithmic axes:

R
Copy code
# Function to calculate the quantity
calculate_quantity <- function(n) {
  result <- 2
  
  for (i in 2:n) {
    result <- result * (2*i / (2*i - 1)) * (2*i / (2*i + 1))
  }
  
  return(result)
}

# Values of n from 5 to 500
n_values <- seq(5, 500, by = 5)

# Calculate the outputs for each value of n
output_values <- sapply(n_values, calculate_quantity)

# Create a scatterplot with logarithmic axes
plot(n_values, output_values, log = "xy", xlab = "log(n)", ylab = "log(Output)", main = "Logarithmic Scatterplot")

# Add a trendline
fit <- lm(log(output_values) ~ log(n_values))
abline(fit, col = "red")

# Show the plot
In this modified code, the log = "xy" argument is added to the plot function to set both the x-axis and y-axis on a logarithmic scale. The linear regression trendline is then applied to the logarithmically transformed data.

Interpreting the logarithmic scatterplot involves considering how the relationships manifest on a logarithmic scale. Patterns and trends in the log-transformed data may reveal insights that might not be as apparent in a linear-scale scatterplot. Analyze the log-transformed scatterplot to observe any patterns, trends, or relationships between log(n) and log(Output).

Ask `R` to report the first six observations in `data(cars)`, and count how many observations and variables are in the dataset. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! You can use the head() function to display the first six observations in the cars dataset and the dim() function to find the number of observations and variables. Here's the R code:

R
Copy code
# Load the cars dataset
data(cars)

# Display the first six observations
first_six_observations <- head(cars)
print("First six observations:")
print(first_six_observations)

# Count the number of observations and variables
num_observations <- nrow(cars)
num_variables <- ncol(cars)
print(paste("Number of observations:", num_observations))
print(paste("Number of variables:", num_variables))
This code first loads the cars dataset, then prints the first six observations and reports the number of observations and variables in the dataset. Run this code in your R environment to see the results.

Create a scatterplot of  variables in `cars`. Explain your observations on the scatter plot. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! You can create a scatterplot of the variables in the cars dataset using the plot() function. Here's the R code to generate the scatterplot:

R
Copy code
# Load the cars dataset
data(cars)

# Create a scatterplot
plot(cars, main = "Scatterplot of Variables in 'cars' Dataset", xlab = "Speed", ylab = "Dist")
This code generates a scatterplot with the speed variable on the x-axis and the dist (distance) variable on the y-axis. The main argument sets the title of the plot, and xlab and ylab set the labels for the x and y axes, respectively.

Interpreting the scatterplot:

The scatterplot should show points representing each observation in the dataset, where x represents the speed and y represents the distance.
Observations that are higher on the y-axis indicate longer stopping distances for higher speeds.
You may observe a general trend or pattern in the data points, such as a positive correlation between speed and distance.
Remember that scatterplots provide a visual representation of the relationship between two variables. Look for patterns, trends, or any outliers in the data points to draw conclusions about the relationship between speed and stopping distance in the cars dataset.
