We will apply clustering methods on the `penguins` dataset in the package `palmerpenguins` for Questions 1 to 6. Note that we will ignore the `species` variable to pretend that we are dealing with an unsupervised learning problem. With the `species` available, this will become a classification problem. 

(1) Briefly summarize the `penguins` data set. In addition to basic description of the dataset (sample size, variables, background), please be sure to read the background of this data set and provide proper citation to this data set.  

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
# Load the penguins dataset

From ChatGPT: The penguins dataset is a popular dataset in the field of data science and is often used for educational purposes. It consists of data related to three species of penguins: Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. The dataset contains various physical measurements of penguins, such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. These measurements are used to distinguish between the different penguin species.

The background of this dataset is that it was collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a Long Term Ecological Research program funded by the National Science Foundation. The data was first made available on GitHub by Allison Horst and was later included in the palmerpenguins R package.

Here's a brief summary of the penguins dataset:

Sample size: 344 observations
Variables:
Species (factor with levels Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo)
Island (factor with levels Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen)
Culmen Length (numeric, in mm)
Culmen Depth (numeric, in mm)
Flipper Length (numeric, in mm)
Body Mass (numeric, in grams)
Sex (factor with levels female, male)
Delta 15 N (numeric)
Delta 13 C (numeric)

(2) Create a data set with no missing values in `bill_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`. Then, create a scatterplot of `body_mass_g` v.s. `bill_length_mm`, where the observations are colored by their true species. 
```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
# Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins")

# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_clean <- penguins[complete.cases(penguins[c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")]), ]

# Create scatterplot colored by species
ggplot(penguins_clean, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)", 
       color = "Species",
       title = "Scatterplot of Body Mass vs. Bill Length")
```

***

(3) Apply spectral clustering using the `specc()` function in package `kernlab` using the provided code.  Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot. Compare the new plot with the one in Part 2. Explain your findings. 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
#install.packages("kernlab")
library(kernlab)
#spec.cluster<-penguins.narm %>% select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>% as.matrix() %>% specc(centers=3)

# Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins")

# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_narm <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")])

# Apply spectral clustering
spec_cluster <- penguins_narm %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  specc(centers = 3)

# Check the cluster assignments
head(spec_cluster)

# Add cluster labels to the dataset
penguins_narm$cluster <- as.factor(spec_cluster)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)", 
       color = "Cluster",
       title = "Scatterplot of Body Mass vs. Bill Length (Specialized Cluster)")
```
To compare both plots, the spectral clustering plot is able to visually present cluster separation. To interpret further, we may conclude that the algorithm is more able to effectively separate the data as the cluster points are not overlapping with each other, as we see in the first plot. The clusters are also separated by row, and has an overall pyramid shape, where cluster 1 has the widest width, whereas cluster 3 has the shortest.

***

(4) Standardize the two variables using the `scale()` function. Run spectral clustering on the standardized data, and visualize the new clusters. How do the new clusters differ from those in Part 3? 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT

# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_narm <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")])

# Standardize the variables
penguins_scaled <- penguins_narm %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  scale()

# Apply spectral clustering on the standardized data
spec_cluster_scaled <- specc(penguins_scaled, centers = 3)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster <- as.factor(spec_cluster_scaled)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", 
       color = "Cluster",
       title = "Scatterplot of Body Mass vs. Bill Length (Standardized Cluster)")
```

***

To compare this plot with the previous, the cluster size is more evened out, while maintaining its overall pyramid shape, indicating a better distributed cluster. Similarly, the clusters are separated without overlap. Based on the equal size, the clusters also have almost the same density.

(5) Apply k-means clustering with $k=3$ on the scaled data. Visualize the clusters and comment on your findings. 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT

# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_narm <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")])

# Standardize the variables
penguins_scaled <- penguins_narm %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  scale()

# Apply k-means clustering on the scaled data
kmeans_cluster <- kmeans(penguins_scaled, centers = 3)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_cluster$cluster)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", 
       y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", 
       color = "Cluster",
       title = "Scatterplot of Body Mass vs. Bill Length (K-Means Cluster)")
```
While the K-Means Cluster is almost similar to the previous plot, we are able to interpret that the K-Means cluster has the best distribution among all previous plots, meaning that the cluster sizes are about equal with one another. However, we can see that cluster 2 has sparser points, compared to the more dense clusters 1 and 3.

***

(6) Modify the code in Part 4 to obtain 5 and 8 clusters using spectral clustering. Comment on your findings, and share your thoughts on how to select the number of clusters when the true labels are unknown.

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_narm <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")])

# Standardize the variables
penguins_scaled <- penguins_narm %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  scale()

# Apply spectral clustering on the standardized data with 5 clusters
spec_cluster_scaled_5 <- specc(penguins_scaled, centers = 5)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster_5 <- as.factor(spec_cluster_scaled_5)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot for 5 clusters
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster_5)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", color = "Cluster (5)")

# Apply spectral clustering on the standardized data with 8 clusters
spec_cluster_scaled_8 <- specc(penguins_scaled, centers = 8)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster_8 <- as.factor(spec_cluster_scaled_8)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot for 8 clusters
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster_8)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", color = "Cluster (8)")
```

***

(7) We will investigate popular names in the `babynames` data set in Questions 7 - 12. Briefly summarize the `babynames` data set. In particular, what does each row represents?

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
# Load the babynames dataset
data("babynames")

# Display the structure of the dataset
str(babynames)

# Summary statistics of the dataset
summary(babynames)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(babynames)

# Display the last few rows of the dataset
tail(babynames)

# Number of unique names
num_unique_names <- length(unique(babynames$name))
cat("Number of unique names:", num_unique_names, "\n")

# Number of unique years
num_unique_years <- length(unique(babynames$year))
cat("Number of unique years:", num_unique_years, "\n")

# Total number of records
total_records <- nrow(babynames)
cat("Total number of records:", total_records, "\n")

# Gender distribution
gender_distribution <- table(babynames$sex)
print(gender_distribution)
```
The babynames data set in R typically contains information about the frequency of baby names given to newborns in the United States over the years. Each row represents a unique combination of a baby name, its gender, and the number of occurrences of that name in a specific year. The data set usually includes columns such as "name," "sex" (gender), "year," and "count" (the number of occurrences of the name in that year). This data set is often used for analyzing trends in baby names over time and exploring cultural preferences in naming practices.

***

(8) Extract names used by no fewer than 500 babies in 2017 for each sex.   

```{r}
# Obtained from ChatGPT
# Load the babynames dataset
data("babynames")

# Filter names for 2017 and count greater than or equal to 500
filtered_names_male <- babynames %>%
  filter(year == 2017, sex == "M", n <= 500)

filtered_names_female <- babynames %>%
  filter(year == 2017, sex == "F", n <= 500)

# Display the result
print(filtered_names_male)
print(filtered_names_female)
```

***

(9) Create two new datasets where each row corresponds to one year and each column corresponds to the `prop` of a name in the list of names selected in Part 8, one per sex. 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
filtered_names_male <- babynames %>%
  filter(year == 2017, sex == "M", n >= 500)

filtered_names_female <- babynames %>%
  filter(year == 2017, sex == "F", n >= 500)

# Extract unique names for each sex
unique_names_male <- unique(filtered_names_male$name)
unique_names_female <- unique(filtered_names_female$name)

# Create datasets for each sex
dataset_male <- babynames %>%
  filter(sex == "M", name %in% unique_names_male) %>%
  select(year, name, prop)

dataset_female <- babynames %>%
  filter(sex == "F", name %in% unique_names_female) %>%
  select(year, name, prop)

# Reshape the datasets
wide_dataset_male <- spread(dataset_male, name, prop, fill = 0)
wide_dataset_female <- spread(dataset_female , name, prop, fill = 0)

# Display the results
print(wide_dataset_male)
print(wide_dataset_female)
```

***

(10) Apply PCA on the data set for female created in Part 9. 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT
# Assuming you have the female_dataset from Part 9
# Load required library
library(stats)

# Select only the columns containing proportions (excluding 'year' column)
female_data_for_pca <- wide_dataset_female %>%
  select(-year)

# Apply PCA
pca_result <- prcomp(female_data_for_pca, scale. = TRUE)

# Extract principal components
principal_components <- pca_result$x

# Display summary of PCA
summary(pca_result)
```

***

(11) How many PCs would you choose to capture this data? Can you offer any insights into the PCs? 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT

# Plot the scree plot
plot(1:length(pca_result$sdev), pca_result$sdev^2 / sum(pca_result$sdev^2),
     type = "b", pch = 16, xlab = "Principal Component", ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained")

# Extract eigenvalues from PCA result
eigenvalues <- pca_result$sdev^2

# Count the number of eigenvalues greater than 1
num_components <- sum(eigenvalues > 1)

# Print the number of principal components according to the Kaiser criterion
cat("Number of principal components according to Kaiser criterion:", num_components, "\n")

```
From ChatGPT: The Kaiser Criterion suggests retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1. Retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1 means each retained PC explains more variance than an individual original variable. 

***

(12) Visualize how the coefficients of the top five PCs change over years on the female data set. Discuss your findings. 

```{r}
#Obtained from ChatGPT

# Extract the top five PCs
top_five_pcs <- pca_result$rotation[, 1:5]

# Create a dataframe for visualization
unique_years <- unique(dataset_female$year)
common_years <- intersect(unique_years, rownames(top_five_pcs))

coefficients_df <- data.frame(year = common_years, top_five_pcs[common_years, ])

# Melt the dataframe for easy plotting
library(reshape2)
coefficients_melted <- melt(coefficients_df, id.vars = "year", variable.name = "PC", value.name = "Coefficient")

# Plot the coefficients
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(coefficients_melted, aes(x = year, y = Coefficient, color = PC, group = PC)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Change in Coefficients of Top 5 PCs Over Years (Female Dataset)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Coefficient",
       color = "PC") +
  theme_minimal()

```

To modify the code to obtain 5 and 8 clusters using spectral clustering, you can simply change the centers parameter in the specc() function to the desired number of clusters. Here's the modified code:

R
Copy code
# Load required libraries
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(kernlab)  # Ensure kernlab is loaded for the specc() function

# Load the penguins dataset
data("penguins")

# Remove rows with missing values in bill_length_mm and body_mass_g
penguins_narm <- na.omit(penguins[, c("bill_length_mm", "body_mass_g")])

# Standardize the variables
penguins_scaled <- penguins_narm %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  scale()

# Apply spectral clustering on the standardized data with 5 clusters
spec_cluster_scaled_5 <- specc(penguins_scaled, centers = 5)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster_5 <- as.factor(spec_cluster_scaled_5)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot for 5 clusters
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster_5)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", color = "Cluster (5)")

# Apply spectral clustering on the standardized data with 8 clusters
spec_cluster_scaled_8 <- specc(penguins_scaled, centers = 8)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
penguins_narm$cluster_8 <- as.factor(spec_cluster_scaled_8)

# Visualize the clusters in a scatterplot for 8 clusters
ggplot(penguins_narm, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = cluster_8)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Standardized Bill Length (mm)", y = "Standardized Body Mass (g)", color = "Cluster (8)")
This code first applies spectral clustering on the standardized data with 5 clusters and then with 8 clusters using the specc() function. It then adds cluster labels to the original dataset and visualizes the clusters in separate scatterplots for 5 and 8 clusters.

how do i interpret/compare the cluster plots
ChatGPT
Interpreting and comparing cluster plots involves understanding the distribution of data points across clusters and assessing how well the clustering algorithm has separated the data into distinct groups. Here's how you can interpret and compare the cluster plots:

Number of Clusters: When comparing cluster plots, first consider the number of clusters generated by the algorithm. In your case, you have generated cluster plots for 5 and 8 clusters, respectively.

Cluster Separation: Look for clear separation between clusters in the plots. Ideally, data points within a cluster should be close to each other and well-separated from data points in other clusters. If clusters overlap significantly, it may indicate that the algorithm is not effectively separating the data.

Cluster Size: Check the size of each cluster. Balanced cluster sizes suggest that the algorithm has successfully grouped the data points into meaningful clusters. Highly imbalanced cluster sizes may indicate that the algorithm is biased towards certain clusters or that some clusters represent outliers or noise.

Cluster Centers: If the clustering algorithm provides cluster centers, you can inspect these to understand the centroids of each cluster in the feature space. This can help you interpret the characteristics of each cluster.

Cluster Density: Consider the density of data points within each cluster. Denser clusters indicate that the data points within that cluster are more similar to each other, while sparser clusters may have more variability.

Cluster Labels: If your data has ground truth labels (i.e., true species labels in the case of the penguins dataset), you can compare the cluster assignments generated by the algorithm with the true labels. Assess the correspondence between clusters and true groups to evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.

Overall, when comparing cluster plots, you're looking for clear separation between clusters, balanced cluster sizes, and meaningful groupings of data points that align with the underlying structure of your data. Additionally, it's important to consider the specific context of your analysis and whether the clusters obtained make sense in that context.

Error in count >= 500 : 
  comparison (>=) is possible only for atomic and list types
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It appears I misunderstood your dataset. If "count" is not a numeric column in your dataset, it might be stored as a factor or character. In that case, you need to convert it to a numeric type before applying the comparison. Here's the revised code:

R
Copy code
# Load the babynames dataset
data("babynames")

# Convert "count" to numeric
babynames$count <- as.numeric(as.character(babynames$count))

# Filter names for 2017 and count greater than or equal to 500 for each sex
filtered_names_male <- subset(babynames, year == 2017 & sex == "M" & count >= 500)
filtered_names_female <- subset(babynames, year == 2017 & sex == "F" & count >= 500)

# Display the result
print(filtered_names_male)
print(filtered_names_female)
This code first converts the "count" column to numeric using as.numeric(as.character()), and then applies the filtering condition. Please try this updated code, and let me know if you encounter any further issues.

How many PCs would you choose to capture this data? Can you offer any insights into the PCsHow many PCs would you choose to capture this data? Can you offer any insights into the PCs
ChatGPT
To determine how many principal components (PCs) to choose to capture the data, you typically look at the scree plot. The scree plot displays the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

Here's how you can interpret the scree plot:

Look for the "elbow" or point where the plot starts to flatten out. This is typically where you should stop adding principal components.
Principal components to the left of the elbow explain a significant amount of variance, while those to the right explain less.
Once you've identified the elbow, you can select the number of principal components that explain a substantial portion of the variance.

Additionally, you can consider using the Kaiser criterion, which suggests retaining principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1.

Here's a summary of possible approaches:

Look for the elbow in the scree plot.
Use the Kaiser criterion.
Choose a predefined number of principal components based on prior knowledge or practical considerations.
If you provide the scree plot or the summary of the PCA results, I can help you interpret them and provide insights into the principal components. Let me know if you need further assistance!

ChatGPT
The provided code snippet applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the female dataset and displays a summary of the PCA results. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

library(stats): This line loads the stats package, which is a core package in R and contains functions for statistical analysis, including PCA.

female_data_for_pca <- wide_dataset_female %>% select(-year): This line selects all columns from the wide_dataset_female except the "year" column, as PCA is typically applied to numeric variables only.

pca_result <- prcomp(female_data_for_pca, scale. = TRUE): This line applies PCA to the selected data (female_data_for_pca). The scale. = TRUE argument scales the variables to have unit variance before PCA, which is a common practice to ensure variables are comparable.

principal_components <- pca_result$x: This line extracts the principal components from the PCA result. The principal components are the transformed variables that capture the most variance in the original data.

summary(pca_result): This line displays a summary of the PCA results, including the standard deviations of the principal components, the proportion of variance explained by each component, and cumulative proportion of variance explained.

By examining the summary of the PCA results, you can gain insights into how much variance is captured by each principal component and decide how many principal components to retain based on your analysis goals and the proportion of variance explained.

User
How many PCs would you choose to capture this data? Can you offer any insights into the PCs? 
ChatGPT
To determine how many principal components (PCs) to choose to capture the data, you typically examine the scree plot or consider the Kaiser criterion, which suggests retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1.

Scree Plot: The scree plot shows the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. You typically look for an "elbow" in the plot, where the proportion of variance explained by each subsequent PC starts to level off. You might choose to retain the PCs before this elbow.

Kaiser Criterion: This criterion suggests retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1. Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each PC. Retaining PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1 means each retained PC explains more variance than an individual original variable.

Additionally, you can consider the cumulative proportion of variance explained by the retained PCs. You might aim to retain enough PCs to capture a significant portion of the total variance in the data, such as 70-80%.

Once you've determined the number of PCs to retain, you can interpret each PC to understand the patterns in the data it represents. PC loadings indicate the relationship between the original variables and the PCs. High loadings (positive or negative) suggest strong associations between variables and the corresponding PC.

Here's an example of how you might interpret the first few PCs:

PC1: Represents the most variance in the data. High loadings on certain variables suggest those variables contribute most to the variation captured by PC1.
PC2: Represents additional variance orthogonal to PC1. Variables with high loadings on PC2 but low loadings on PC1 capture unique variance not explained by PC1.
PC3, PC4, ...: Capture progressively smaller amounts of variance, representing finer patterns or noise in the data.
To make a decision on how many PCs to retain for your specific analysis, you'll need to examine the scree plot, consider the Kaiser criterion, and evaluate the cumulative proportion of variance explained. Additionally, domain knowledge and research goals can influence the decision-making process.

give me the scree plot code in r
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how you can create a scree plot in R using the pca_result object obtained from your PCA analysis:

This code will create a scree plot where the x-axis represents the principal components and the y-axis represents the proportion of variance explained by each component. The ^2 / sum(pca_result$sdev^2) part normalizes the variance explained by each component to the total variance explained by all components.

You can use this plot to identify the point (the "elbow") where the proportion of variance explained starts to level off, helping you decide how many principal components to retain. Let me know if you need further assistance!

In R, the tilde (~) symbol is commonly used in formulas to specify relationships between variables in statistical models or plotting functions. Here's how it's typically used:

Model Formula: In statistical modeling functions like lm() (linear regression), glm() (generalized linear models), or lmer() (linear mixed-effects models), the tilde symbol separates the response variable from the predictor variables. For example:

r
Copy code
lm_model <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = my_data)
Here, y is the response variable, and x1 and x2 are predictor variables.

Plotting Functions: In plotting functions like ggplot(), the tilde symbol is used to specify the relationship between variables on the x-axis and y-axis. For example:

r
Copy code
ggplot(data = my_data, aes(x = x_var, y = y_var)) + geom_point()
Here, x_var is plotted on the x-axis, and y_var is plotted on the y-axis.

Formula Objects: In some cases, formulas themselves can be stored as objects in R. For instance:

r
Copy code
my_formula <- y ~ x1 + x2
This can then be used as a formula in various functions.

The tilde symbol is a fundamental part of R syntax for specifying relationships between variables in formulas and is widely used in statistical modeling and data visualization.

Visualize how the coefficients of the top five PCs change over years on the female data set. Discuss your findings.
ChatGPT
To visualize how the coefficients of the top five principal components (PCs) change over years on the female dataset, you can create line plots for each PC, with years on the x-axis and coefficients on the y-axis. This will provide insights into how the importance of different names (features) changes over time with respect to each PC.

Here's how you can do it:

r
Copy code
# Assuming you have the female_dataset from Part 9
# Assuming you have already conducted PCA and obtained pca_result

# Extract the top five PCs
top_five_pcs <- pca_result$rotation[, 1:5]

# Create a dataframe for visualization
coefficients_df <- data.frame(year = female_dataset$year, top_five_pcs)

# Melt the dataframe for easy plotting
library(reshape2)
coefficients_melted <- melt(coefficients_df, id.vars = "year", variable.name = "PC", value.name = "Coefficient")

# Plot the coefficients
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(coefficients_melted, aes(x = year, y = Coefficient, color = PC, group = PC)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Change in Coefficients of Top 5 PCs Over Years (Female Dataset)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Coefficient",
       color = "PC") +
  theme_minimal()
This code will generate a line plot showing how the coefficients of the top five principal components change over the years for the female dataset. Each PC will be represented by a different color, allowing you to visualize the trends in coefficient values over time.

Now, for discussing your findings:

Interpretation of Coefficients: Positive or negative coefficients for specific names (features) indicate their influence on each principal component. A large coefficient magnitude suggests a strong association between that name and the corresponding PC.

Patterns Over Time: Look for any consistent patterns or significant changes in coefficient values over the years. Are there any names that consistently have high or low coefficients across multiple PCs? Are there any noticeable trends or shifts in coefficients for specific names over time?

Comparison Between PCs: Compare the coefficient trends across different PCs. Do certain names show similar or opposite trends across different PCs? Are there any names that have consistently high or low coefficients across all PCs?

By analyzing these trends in the coefficient values over time, you can gain insights into how the importance of different names varies with respect to each principal component and how this might relate to underlying patterns or trends in the data.

Error in data.frame(year = dataset_female$year, top_five_pcs) : 
  arguments imply differing number of rows: 51627, 597
ChatGPT
The error indicates that there's a mismatch in the number of rows between the year column and the top_five_pcs matrix. This usually happens when the dataset used for PCA (female_dataset) has a different number of rows compared to the matrix of principal component coefficients (top_five_pcs).

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that both the year column and the matrix of principal component coefficients have the same number of rows. Here's how you can address it:

r
Copy code
# Assuming you have the female_dataset from Part 9
# Assuming you have already conducted PCA and obtained pca_result

# Extract the top five PCs
top_five_pcs <- pca_result$rotation[, 1:5]

# Create a dataframe for visualization
coefficients_df <- data.frame(year = unique(female_dataset$year), top_five_pcs)

# Melt the dataframe for easy plotting
library(reshape2)
coefficients_melted <- melt(coefficients_df, id.vars = "year", variable.name = "PC", value.name = "Coefficient")

# Plot the coefficients
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(coefficients_melted, aes(x = year, y = Coefficient, color = PC, group = PC)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Change in Coefficients of Top 5 PCs Over Years (Female Dataset)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Coefficient",
       color = "PC") +
  theme_minimal()
In this updated code:

We ensure that the year column in the dataframe coefficients_df contains only unique years from the female_dataset, so that it matches the number of rows in top_five_pcs.
Then, we melt the dataframe and proceed with plotting as before.
This should resolve the error, and you'll be able to visualize how the coefficients of the top five PCs change over years on the female dataset. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Error in data.frame(year = unique(dataset_female$year), top_five_pcs) : 
  arguments imply differing number of rows: 138, 597
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. The error suggests that there is still a mismatch in the number of rows between the year column and the top_five_pcs matrix. Let's make sure that both have the same number of rows.

Assuming dataset_female has a different number of rows compared to the top_five_pcs matrix, you should first check the number of unique years in dataset_female and ensure that there is a corresponding row in the top_five_pcs matrix for each unique year. Here's a revised version of the code:

r
Copy code
# Assuming you have the female_dataset from Part 9
# Assuming you have already conducted PCA and obtained pca_result

# Extract the top five PCs
top_five_pcs <- pca_result$rotation[, 1:5]

# Create a dataframe for visualization
unique_years <- unique(female_dataset$year)
common_years <- intersect(unique_years, rownames(top_five_pcs))

coefficients_df <- data.frame(year = common_years, top_five_pcs[common_years, ])

# Melt the dataframe for easy plotting
library(reshape2)
coefficients_melted <- melt(coefficients_df, id.vars = "year", variable.name = "PC", value.name = "Coefficient")

# Plot the coefficients
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(coefficients_melted, aes(x = year, y = Coefficient, color = PC, group = PC)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Change in Coefficients of Top 5 PCs Over Years (Female Dataset)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Coefficient",
       color = "PC") +
  theme_minimal()
In this updated code:

We find the common years that exist in both the dataset_female and the rows of top_five_pcs.
We create a dataframe (coefficients_df) using only the common years and the corresponding rows of top_five_pcs.
Then, we proceed with melting and plotting as before.
This should address the mismatch in the number of rows. Please try this code, and let me know if it resolves the issue.
